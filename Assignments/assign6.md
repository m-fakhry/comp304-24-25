# Assignment 6

## Lab 

- Implement a parser to describe the language of all mathematical expressions generated by the following CFG
    ```
    Exp -> Term Expr
    Expr ->  + Term Expr | - Term Expr | e
    Term -> Factor Termp
    Termp -> â€€* Factor Termp | â€€/ Factor Termp | e  
    Factor -> ( Exp ) | id
    ```

- validate your parser on the string `id + (id - id) / id`.
