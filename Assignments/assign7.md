# Assignment 7 

This assignment covers two weeks

## Lab 

- Complete the parser form the last assignment 

- Apply the parser on different grammars 

- (Optional) implement the first and follow algorithm, and a function that generates the predictive table

- Integrate the scanner and parser so that the program takes the raw input string and passes it to the scanner to generate the sequence of tokens, then calls the parser to parse the tokens sequence

**Objectives**:

- Apply the life cycle of the compiler. The code should accept any string from the language and reject any string not from the language
    
**Skills**:

- Read table of rules from a text file. What would be the suitable data structure

- Understand parsing based on predefined rules from table

## Paper 

- From the supplementary book, 

    - read section 4.5.1 Reductions, 4.5.2 Handle Pruning, 4.5.3 Shift-Reduce Parsing, 4.5.4 Conflicts During Shift-Reduce Parsing (p 233-240)

    - solve exercise 4.5.3 (p 241)

- (Optional) From the main book, read section 3.4
