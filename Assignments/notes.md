# Skills we learned 

What we have learned from lab activities during the entire semester are the following 

- **(data structure)** how to read text, grammar (production rules, terminals, non-terminals), parsing tables, automaton, etc. from a text file
- **(algorithm)** how to use these data structure to apply some algorithms such as computing first, follow sets, generating parsing tables, etc. 
- **(scanner)** how to implement scanner to convert stream of symbols into stream of tokens by applying some regular expressions or DFAs
- **(parser)** how to implement parser to parse a string and generate the parsing sequence to test whether the string is accepted
