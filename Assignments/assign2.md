# Assignment 2

1. Read Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.5. (Optional) From the supplementary book read 3.4, 3.6

2. **(Paper)** Write a DFA to describe the language of all strings of a's and b's that do not contain the subsequence `abb`. **The FA should reject any invalid string and should accept any valid string**.

3. **(Paper - Optional)** Write a regular expression for the language described in the previous point (We haven't yet talked in the lecture about RE).

4. **(Lab)** Write a C++ program that reads a file that has two lines 
    ```
    (1,2)
    (1,red)
    ```
    and generates the corresponding stream of tokens written in a file. The implementation should be "simple" and hard-coded as explained in the lecture
