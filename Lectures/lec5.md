- emphasize the role of scanner and table driven scanner 
- mention directed-code and hand-coded scanner 
- start CFG and what it can offer than RE 
- Derivation, priority, ambiguous grammar 
- grammar for expression: add/ mul, paran, variable 

- parser:
	- top-down: recursive descend, and LL1 
	- bottom-up: LR1 
- we need grammr that migh have different production for the same start non terminal / terminal to show the idea of backtrack 
- change the implementation of the scanner to make all tkens in the same line 
- eliminate left recursion
