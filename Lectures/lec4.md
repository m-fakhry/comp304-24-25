# Lecture 4

### Open Discussion
	- How to link the lecture with the assignment 
		- The lecture is clear but we do not know what to do after that 
	- We discussed the difficulty of assignments 
		- There is no guideline on how to start the assignment as there are many ways to solve the assignment 

### Action Items
	- For each assignment, we need to put the skills that the assignment is targeting 
	- After each assignment, it would be better for TAs to send a skeleton for the solution 

<!-- ### Scanner Types
	- table-driven
	- directed-code (each state is a function in the code)
	- hand-crafted scanner (using buffer to reduce IO operations) -->
